    <p>
        I'm an M.Tech student at <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/">IIT Kharagpur</a> with a graduation in Metallurgical & Material Science Engineering from <a href="https://www.msubaroda.ac.in/">The M. S. University of Baroda</a>. I'm also an Ex Assistant Manager from <a href="https://www.amns.in/">AM/NS India</a> (Previously known as Essar Steel Limited)
        
        Along with the curriculum at IIT, I am currently involved in building a <a href="https://gatemetallurgy.in"> GATE Metallurgy</a> brand for GATE MT aspirants to help them with information and knowledge access. An Instagram page with concept shots, a website with video courses, GATE MT info and a WhatsApp community for doubts solving are currently the focus.

    <p>
        During B.E. I had the opportunity to undertake a project on "Modelling and Simulation of Continuous Casting to improve Surface Defects problem in Steel Slabs". The project was a milestone in my career and was appreciated by the faculties as well as the engineering consultants at AM/NS. Metallurgical Engineering is my proud career choice but web development, graphic design, photography and video editing are also an integral part of my passion. All GATE Metallurgy project assets are designed and developed by me. I have also been a freelance photographer and videographer during my undergraduate years.
